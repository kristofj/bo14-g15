Our bachelor's project are to create two weather stations that measure temperature, air pressure, wind speed and wind direction. These data will be stored on a server at Høyskolen i Østfold. The data will be visualized on the homepage of Project Hessdalen. The report provides an introduction to the group and our task. Further on we describe how we have planned our work, how the production went, how we have tested our product and ultimately a reflection of how we think things have gone. What could be better and what we are satisfied with.
